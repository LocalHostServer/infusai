                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce has been helping organizations manage their customer
                                    databases for over two decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record,
                                    store, analyze, share, and track your valuable records to provide personalized
                                    services to your customers. Right from identifying a prospect to turning them into
                                    loyal customers, Salesforce ensures that you are there for your customers at all
                                    different stages of their buying journeys</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad
                                    of different tools and features. This has made the CRM giant divide its features
                                    into different products known as Salesforce Clouds. </p>
                                <p class="mt-3">Every Salesforce Cloud is an offering that provides users with a
                                    specific set of tools and features. These features can be related to a specific
                                    sector of industry or a department within an organization. For example, while
                                    Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to help institutions in the healthcare sector
                                    streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing Cloud helps the marketing department
                                    of an organization reach out to the clients better. </p>
                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Cloud services divided into these offerings allow
                                    users to choose the products that are best suited for them. Irrespective of the
                                    scale at which you operate and the industry you belong to, you will always find a
                                    Salesforce Cloud that is in sync with your needs and preferences.</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">While there are many different Salesforce products you can
                                    choose from, there are three core Salesforce Clouds that are highly preferred by
                                    users around the world – Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud.</p>
