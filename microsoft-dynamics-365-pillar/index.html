                                            <p class="mt-4">Microsoft Dynamics 365 is business process software launched
                                                in
                                                2016 when Microsoft decided to combine the native ERP and CRM.</p>
                                            <p class="">Microsoft built the software in two editions:</p>
                                            <p class=""><b>Business edition:</b> It is the more expensive and advanced
                                                edition with more built-in features that can harness various domains and
                                                vernaculars of a business.</p>
                                            <p class=""><b>Enterprise edition:</b> This edition is more compatible for
                                                the small businesses as it has comparatively fewer features though
                                                highly effective and can easily incorporate the CRM and ERP of a
                                                small-midsize business.</p>

                                                productivity applications, users get a integrated view of data
                                                intelligence on customer records, behaviors,transactions and

                                                in addition to predictive tools for decision-makers.</p>
                                            <p class="">One of the great benefits of Dynamic 365 is its perfect
                                                integration with other Microsoft software, which saves a lot of time,
                                                efforts and resources for a business that relies on Microsoft office
                                                365, outlook or Azure. Dynamic 365 provides more options for integration
