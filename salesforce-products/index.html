                                <p class="mt-3">Over the last few years, we witnessed a number of organizations
                                    operating across all major industries make the much-needed switch to digitization.
                                    It took a global pandemic for businesses to understand the importance of process
                                    automation and cloud-based functionality. As more and more companies are embracing
                                    digitization, the demand for Salesforce products is increasing across the board.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce products and services have been in the market for over two
                                    decades now. The CRM platform allows users to manage their valuable records on a
                                    centralized cloud-based platform. It has been helping organizations operating at all
                                    scales to record, store, share, track, and analyze their customer databases to
                                    provide personalized services to their customers. </p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Every Salesforce Cloud is an offering that provides users with a
                                    specific set of tools
                                    and features. These features can be related to a specific sector of industry or a
                                    department within an
                                    organization. For example, while Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to help
                                    institutions in the
                                    healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing Cloud helps the
                                    marketing department
                                    of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Over two decades, Salesforce has been consistent in helping businesses
                                    reach out to their customers and obtain a 360-degree view of their processes on a
                                    single unified platform. </p>
                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce is a fairly vast platform with a number of tools, features,
                                    add-ons, and applications. Its functionality is divided into different Salesforce
                                    products that can be used by organizations based on their specific needs and
                                    preferences.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">So, what are these Salesforce products?</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce products are nothing but the different offerings of the CRM
                                    platform that help users achieve specific goals and provide them with a specific set
                                    of tools. Different Salesforce CRM products focus on different industries or
                                    departments operating within the organization. For example, while Salesforce Sales
                                    Cloud allows your sales reps to streamline their processes, the Marketing Cloud is
                                    designed to improve your marketing processes.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Thanks to the versatility of the CRM platform, there is a range of
                                    different Salesforce products you can choose from based on the objectives you want
                                    to achieve, the customers you want to target, the users you want to deploy. </p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Here are some of the most important Salesforce products you should be
                                    aware of in 2022:</p>
