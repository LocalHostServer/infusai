                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce has been helping organizations manage their customer databases for over two
                  decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record, store, analyze, share, and track your
                  valuable records to provide personalized services to your customers. Right from identifying a prospect
                  to turning them into loyal customers, Salesforce ensures that you are there for your customers at all
                  different stages of their buying journeys. </p>

                <p class="mt-3">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad of different tools and
                  features. This has made the CRM giant divide its features into different products known as Salesforce
                  Clouds. </p>

                <p class="mt-3">Every Salesforce Cloud is an offering that provides users with a specific set of tools
                  and features. These features can be related to a specific sector of industry or a department within an
                  organization. For example, while Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to help institutions in the
                  healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing Cloud helps the marketing department
                  of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">Leverage our years of industry experience and expertise to build, and implement the
                  smartest way
                  Salesforce Cloud services divided into these offerings allow users to choose the products that are
                  best suited for them. Irrespective of the scale at which you operate and the industry you belong to,
                  you will always find a Salesforce Cloud that is in sync with your needs and preferences.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">While there are many different Salesforce products you can choose from, there are three
                  core Salesforce Clouds that are highly preferred by users around the world – Sales Cloud, Service
                  Cloud, and Marketing Cloud.</p>

                        Salesforce for your organization. It involves dedicated Salesforce implementation partners

                        industry you operate in and the department that needs to work on the CRM platform, you can
                        implement different Salesforce products or ‘Clouds’ within your organization. </p>
                      <p class="">With Infusai, you can rest assured that dedicated Salesforce experts would guide you
                        every step of the way in bringing your implementation project to fruition.</p>

                      <p class="">We live in the age of digitization. Gone are the days when organizations used to keep
                        manual records of their customers to cater to their needs. Today, the advent of automated and
                        cloud-based platforms has made customer relationship management (CRM) a lot more efficient. With

                        implementing the CRM giant and the steps involved in the same. </p>
                      <p class="">However, before getting to the crux of this Salesforce implementation guide, let us
                        brush our knowledge of what Salesforce is and why it is relevant in 2022.</p>

                      <p class="bold_heading mt-5">What Is Salesforce And Why Is It Relevant In 2022?</p>
                      <p class="">Salesforce is arguably the most popular CRM platform in the market that helps
                        organizations manage their customer records on a centralized platform. It prevents you from
                        resorting to tedious and time-consuming methods by providing you with automated tools and
                        applications.</p>
                      <p class="">It has been more than two decades since Salesforce was launched. However, the CRM
                        platform is still highly relevant across multiple industries. This is because it has evolved
                        with time and is in sync with the latest technological trends in the market. With Salesforce,
                        you can record, store, track, assess, and share your valuable records to provide personalized
                        services to your customers. Right from sales reps to finance experts, the CRM platform provides
                        users with a 360-degree view of their clients and multiple ways of connecting with same.</p>
                      <p class="">The offerings of Salesforce are divided into different products (known as Clouds)
                        based on the features offered by them. Some of the most popular Salesforce offerings include
                        Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, and Field Service
                        Cloud. All these products are designed to help organizations build healthy relationships with
                        their customers.</p>

                      <p class="">Salesforce has been helping organizations manage their customer databases for over two
                        decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record, store, analyze, share, and track
                        your valuable records to provide personalized services to your customers. Right from identifying
                        a prospect to turning them into loyal customers, Salesforce ensures that you are there for your
                        customers at all different stages of their buying journeys.</p>
                      <p class="">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad of different tools and
                        features. This has made the CRM giant divide its features into different products known as
                        Salesforce Clouds.</p>

                        within an organization. For example, while Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to help
                        institutions in the healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing Cloud
                        helps the marketing department of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>
                      <p class="">Salesforce Cloud services divided into these offerings allow users to choose the
                        products that are best suited for them. Irrespective of the scale at which you operate and the
                        industry you belong to, you will always find a Salesforce Cloud that is in sync with your needs

                        king. Almost each of your business processes revolves around catering to the needs and
                        preferences of your customers. They hold a pivotal position in dictating the strategies and
                        approaches of the businesses they engage with.
                        This is why it is important to provide them with adequate support services.</p>

                      <p class="mt-3">Gone are the days when it was okay for businesses to provide generic guides,
                        manuals, and handbooks to their customers in the name of customer service. Customers today
                        demand quick, personalized, and interactive support. If you are willing to build a long and
                        healthy relationship with your customers, you need to make sure that they feel heard and their
                        issues are resolved in the best way possible.</p>

                                <p class="">Case management is the primary feature offered by Salesforce Service Cloud.
                                  Whenever a customer faces any issue and decided to seek help from your organization,
                                  it leads to the creation of a new case.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">There are three distinct ways in which the Service Cloud allows users to
                                  create and manage cases – web-to-case, email-to-case, and escalation. </p>

                                <!-- <p class="mt-3">Web-to-case revolves around the automated creation of a new case when a
                                  user receives a support request from the company’s website. This is when your
                                  customers seek support through your official website. You can either choose to handle
                                  such cases by routing them to the right agents or provide your customers with a
                                  personalized auto-response.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Email-to-case allows Salesforce Service Cloud users to create a new case
                                  when an email looking for support has been sent to the designated email ID of your
                                  business. The software displays all these cases in a list called “Emails Related
                                  List.” This list contains multiple emails related to a single case and different email
                                  threads.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">If a case is not closed within the pre-determined period of time,
                                  Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to use the case escalation rules to reassign the
                                  concerned case and inform the customer about the same. </p> -->

                                <p class="">Conversational AI has brought a revolution in the domain of customer
                                  services. The technology involves the creation of AI chatbots that interact with
                                  customers, understand the context of their questions/issues, and provide them with
                                  personalized solutions without routing the cases to support agents right away.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud employs these virtual assistants in the form of
                                  Einstein bots. These chatbots can be used to overcome the unnecessary delays caused in
                                  resolving basic issues faced by your customers. If a customer raises a simple query,
                                  they can get it resolved by interacting with the chatbots. In case they are not
                                  satisfied with the response, they can ask the chatbots to route their case to a
                                  suitable support agent. This allows you to bring in manual assistance only when
                                  required.</p>

                                  by your organization. It contains all important information regarding your company,
                                  its offerings, and the customers. </p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to optimize Salesforce Knowledge, an
                                  extensive knowledge base where you can create, edit, and manage content. If you are
                                  using chatbots to provide the initial level of support, they would scan the knowledge
                                  base to provide personalized solutions to your customers.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Similarly, if a case is routed to one of your support agents, Salesforce
                                  Knowledge provides them with all information related to the concerned case and the
                                  customer involved. This provides your agent with enough information to understand the

              <p class="bold_heading">A Comprehensive Salesforce Implementation Guide For 2022</p>
              <p class="">We live in the age of digitization. Gone are the days when organizations used to keep manual records of their customers to cater to their needs. Today, the advent of automated and cloud-based platforms has made customer relationship management (CRM) a lot more efficient. With this Salesforce implementation guide, we would understand the different approaches to implementing the CRM giant and the steps involved in the same. </p>
              <p class="">However, before getting to the crux of this Salesforce implementation guide, let us brush our knowledge of what Salesforce is and why it is relevant in 2022.</p>

              <p class="bold_heading mt-5">What Is Salesforce And Why Is It Relevant In 2022?</p>
              <p class="">Salesforce is arguably the most popular CRM platform in the market that helps organizations manage their customer records on a centralized platform. It prevents you from resorting to tedious and time-consuming methods by providing you with automated tools and applications.</p>
              <p class="">It has been more than two decades since Salesforce was launched. However, the CRM platform is still highly relevant across multiple industries. This is because it has evolved with time and is in sync with the latest technological trends in the market. With Salesforce, you can record, store, track, assess, and share your valuable records to provide personalized services to your customers. Right from sales reps to finance experts, the CRM platform provides users with a 360-degree view of their clients and multiple ways of connecting with same.</p>
              <p class="">The offerings of Salesforce are divided into different products (known as Clouds) based on the features offered by them. Some of the most popular Salesforce offerings include Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, and Field Service Cloud. All these products are designed to help organizations build healthy relationships with their customers.</p>
              <p class="">If you are willing to switch to the modern way of handling your customer database, it is important to implement Salesforce the right way.</p>
              <p class="">Essentially, there are two different ways of implementing Salesforce within your organization – the DIY approach and working with a Salesforce implementation partner.</p>

              </div>
              
              <p class="bold_heading mt-5">The DIY Approach To Salesforce Implementation</p>
              <p class="">As the name suggests, the DIY Salesforce implementation approach involves setting up the CRM platform all by yourself. Although it does not require one to have a degree or educational qualification to implement Salesforce, it is never advisable to do so without taking anyone’s help.</p>
              <p class="">Salesforce is a fairly vast platform with a range of different tools, features, and add-ons. Especially if you are entering the world of Salesforce for the first time, it is never advisable to implement the CRM platform by yourself. Even the best Salesforce implementation guide in the world would not help you build a full-proof CRM platform without seeking professional help!</p>
              <p class="">Also, Salesforce implementation is certainly a difficult process and a work of experts. Your internal team may not comprise dedicated Salesforce experts. If you force yourself and your in-house professionals to set up Salesforce, the project is bound to fall apart in the near future.</p>
              <p class="">It is, therefore, advisable to work with a dedicated Salesforce implementation partner.</p>

              <p class="bold_heading mt-5">Why Should You Work With A Salesforce Implementation Partner?</p>
              <p class="">A Salesforce implementation partner is an individual or a dedicated agency that helps organizations implement the CRM platform effectively. They understand your specific needs and preferences to provide you with tailor-made services. </p>
              <p class="">When you hire a Salesforce implementation partner, you have a subject-matter expert at your disposal. They would guide you every step of the way and prevent you from committing errors while implementing Salesforce. Most implementation partners possess years of experience in the domain and are well-versed with all different aspects of the CRM platform. </p>
              <p class="">A lot of organizations ask the question, “how long does it take to implement Salesforce?”</p>
              <p class="">Well, while there is no definite answer for the same, the implementation approach you choose certainly makes a difference. If you venture into Salesforce implementation all by yourself, it will take you way longer to get your work done and start with your operations. On the other hand, working with a Salesforce partner provides you with greater speed and agility. </p>
              <p class="">Now that we have chosen the ideal way of implementing the CRM platform, let us get to the heart of this Salesforce implementation guide.</p>

              <p class="bold_heading mt-5">Steps Involved In Salesforce Implementation</p>
              <p class="">In 2022, you cannot afford to make any mistake when it comes to implementing a cloud-based CRM platform like Salesforce. It is always important to follow the right steps and be systematic in your approach to develop the CRM platform as per your requirements. </p>
              <p class="">Here are some of the most important Salesforce implementation steps you should follow to build an ideal CRM for your organization:</p>
              
              <p class="mt-5"><b>(1) Clearly Define Your Business Goals</b></p>
              <p class="">It is impossible to go anywhere with Salesforce implementation without having well-defined goals. Always start with listing down the important goals that you are willing to achieve through Salesforce implementation.</p>
              <p class="">Here are some important questions to ask yourself while you are defining your business goals:</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  What customers are you willing to cater to?</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Which processes do you want to automate?</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  What are the major issues faced by your organization on a daily basis?</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Do you make use of process automation in the age of digitization?</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Which of your business processes are still traditional and take time?</p>
              <p class="">Answering questions like these would provide you with a clear sense of direction and help you set a strong foundation for Salesforce implementation.</p>

              <p class="mt-5"><b>(2) Identity The Key Stakeholders For The Project</b></p>
              <p class="">Once you are thorough with your goals, you can go ahead with identifying all the major stakeholders to be associated with your Salesforce implementation project. These professionals have a vested interest in implementing the CRM platform and helping you achieve your business goals. </p>
              <p class="">Some of the most noteworthy stakeholders include:</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; End Users –  </b> These are the individuals who would be using Salesforce once it is implemented. Right from sales and marketing reps to customer service executives, anyone can be an end-user based on the business goals to be achieved.</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; Project Manager –  </b> A project manager shoulders the responsibility of bringing your implementation project to fruition. They are responsible for overlooking the entire project, communicating with the clients, coordinating with the team members, and ensuring that the development takes place seamlessly.</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; Super Users – </b> These stakeholders may or may not be involved in using the CRM platform once it is built but help the project managers out in testing the platform. They are associated with the implementation process until the final rollout.</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; Decision Makers – </b> As the name suggests, these are the individuals with the authority to make important decisions regarding your Salesforce implementation project. These decisions may revolve around establishing a project timeline, allocating the budget, ensuring effective communication, and much more.</p>

              <p class="mt-5"><b>(3) Prepare A Budget</b></p>
              <p class="">Another important question asked by organizations related to Salesforce implementation is about the cost of implementation. If you are precise and careful while preparing a budget for your implementation project, the cost of Salesforce implementation would be within your budgetary constraints. However, not preparing an extensive budget or making calculated estimations may make the CRM platform way too costly to implement. </p>
              <p class="">It is, therefore always important to have an extensive budget in place before you go ahead with the implementation. Include all the costs associated with your implementation project and see if the amount is feasible for your organization.</p>
              <p class="">Here, the Salesforce edition you subscribe to plays an important role. On the basis of the features offered, there are four major editions you can subscribe to:</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Salesforce Essentials ($25/user/month)</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Salesforce Professional ($75/user/month)</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Salesforce Enterprise ($150/user/month)</p>
              <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Salesforce Unlimited ($300/user/month)</p>
              <p>Once you have decided upon the edition to choose and the number of users you need, you can calculate other costs related to Salesforce implementation.</p>

              <p class="mt-5"><b>(4) Building The CRM Platform</b></p>
              <p class="">Once you have finalized the cost of implementation, you can start building the CRM platform with the help of your implementation partner. Make sure that you explain your objectives and goals to your Salesforce partner well. This would allow them to add relevant tools and features to the CRM platform. </p>
              <p class="">If needed, you can ask your implementation partner to provide you with different prototypes and versions of your Salesforce org before developing the final version.</p>

              <p class="mt-5"><b>(5) Testing The CRM Platform</b></p>
              <p class="">Once you have finalized the platform, it is time to test its functionality. You can always request your implementation partner for a visual demo to be well-versed with the functionality of your Salesforce org. If you feel the need to make changes, provide them with feedback and ask them to show you the revised platform.</p>

              <p class="mt-5"><b>(6) The Final Launch And User Adoption</b></p>
              <p class="">Once all the tests are successful and you are happy with the final product, you can go live with your Salesforce org and start working on the same. However, if the end-users are not too well-versed with the platform, make sure you arrange for extensive user adoption sessions. This would make your team members comfortable with the CRM platform and give them an ideal kick-start!</p>

              <p class="bold_heading mt-5">The Final Word</p>
              <p class="">This comprehensive Salesforce implementation guide should help you get at least a basic idea about implementing the CRM platform the right way.

                        king. Almost each of your business processes revolves around catering to the needs and
                        preferences of your customers. They hold a pivotal position in dictating the strategies and
                        approaches of the businesses they engage with.
                        This is why it is important to provide them with adequate support services.</p>

                      <p class="mt-3">Gone are the days when it was okay for businesses to provide generic guides,
                        manuals, and handbooks to their customers in the name of customer service. Customers today
                        demand quick, personalized, and interactive support. If you are willing to build a long and
                        healthy relationship with your customers, you need to make sure that they feel heard and their
                        issues are resolved in the best way possible.</p>

                                <p class="">Case management is the primary feature offered by Salesforce Service Cloud.
                                  Whenever a customer faces any issue and decided to seek help from your organization,
                                  it leads to the creation of a new case.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">There are three distinct ways in which the Service Cloud allows users to
                                  create and manage cases – web-to-case, email-to-case, and escalation. </p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Web-to-case revolves around the automated creation of a new case when a
                                  user receives a support request from the company’s website. This is when your
                                  customers seek support through your official website. You can either choose to handle
                                  such cases by routing them to the right agents or provide your customers with a
                                  personalized auto-response.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Email-to-case allows Salesforce Service Cloud users to create a new case
                                  when an email looking for support has been sent to the designated email ID of your
                                  business. The software displays all these cases in a list called “Emails Related
                                  List.” This list contains multiple emails related to a single case and different email
                                  threads.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">If a case is not closed within the pre-determined period of time,
                                  Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to use the case escalation rules to reassign the
                                  concerned case and inform the customer about the same. </p>

                          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="ein_bot" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ein_bot_tab">

                                <p class="">Conversational AI has brought a revolution in the domain of customer
                                  services. The technology involves the creation of AI chatbots that interact with
                                  customers, understand the context of their questions/issues, and provide them with
                                  personalized solutions without routing the cases to support agents right away.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud employs these virtual assistants in the form of
                                  Einstein bots. These chatbots can be used to overcome the unnecessary delays caused in
                                  resolving basic issues faced by your customers. If a customer raises a simple query,
                                  they can get it resolved by interacting with the chatbots. In case they are not
                                  satisfied with the response, they can ask the chatbots to route their case to a
                                  suitable support agent. This allows you to bring in manual assistance only when
                                  required.</p>

                                <p class="">The enterprise knowledge base is one of the most important assets possessed
                                  by your organization. It contains all important information regarding your company,
                                  its offerings, and the customers. </p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to optimize Salesforce Knowledge, an
                                  extensive knowledge base where you can create, edit, and manage content. If you are
                                  using chatbots to provide the initial level of support, they would scan the knowledge
                                  base to provide personalized solutions to your customers.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Similarly, if a case is routed to one of your support agents, Salesforce
                                  Knowledge provides them with all information related to the concerned case and the
                                  customer involved. This provides your agent with enough information to understand the
                                  issue at hand and tailor a resolution best fitted for the situation. </p>

                                <p class="">Case management is the primary feature offered by Salesforce Service Cloud. Whenever a customer faces any issue and decided to seek help from your organization, it leads to the creation of a new case.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">There are three distinct ways in which the Service Cloud allows users to create and manage cases – web-to-case, email-to-case, and escalation. </p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Web-to-case revolves around the automated creation of a new case when a user receives a support request from the company’s website. This is when your customers seek support through your official website. You can either choose to handle such cases by routing them to the right agents or provide your customers with a personalized auto-response.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Email-to-case allows Salesforce Service Cloud users to create a new case when an email looking for support has been sent to the designated email ID of your business. The software displays all these cases in a list called “Emails Related List.” This list contains multiple emails related to a single case and different email threads.</p>

                                <p class="">Conversational AI has brought a revolution in the domain of customer services. The technology involves the creation of AI chatbots that interact with customers, understand the context of their questions/issues, and provide them with personalized solutions without routing the cases to support agents right away.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud employs these virtual assistants in the form of Einstein bots. These chatbots can be used to overcome the unnecessary delays caused in resolving basic issues faced by your customers. If a customer raises a simple query, they can get it resolved by interacting with the chatbots. In case they are not satisfied with the response, they can ask the chatbots to route their case to a suitable support agent. This allows you to bring in manual assistance only when required.</p>

                        <p class="">We live in the age of digitization. Gone are the days when organizations used to
                          keep manual records of their customers to cater to their needs. Today, the advent of automated
                          and cloud-based platforms has made customer relationship management (CRM) a lot more
                          efficient. With this Salesforce implementation guide, we would understand the different
                          approaches to implementing the CRM giant and the steps involved in the same. </p>
                        <p class="">However, before getting to the crux of this Salesforce implementation guide, let us
                          brush our knowledge of what Salesforce is and why it is relevant in 2022.</p>

                        <p class="bold_heading mt-5">What Is Salesforce And Why Is It Relevant In 2022?</p>
                        <p class="">Salesforce is arguably the most popular CRM platform in the market that helps
                          organizations manage their customer records on a centralized platform. It prevents you from
                          resorting to tedious and time-consuming methods by providing you with automated tools and
                          applications.</p>
                        <p class="">It has been more than two decades since Salesforce was launched. However, the CRM
                          platform is still highly relevant across multiple industries. This is because it has evolved
                          with time and is in sync with the latest technological trends in the market. With Salesforce,
                          you can record, store, track, assess, and share your valuable records to provide personalized
                          services to your customers. Right from sales reps to finance experts, the CRM platform
                          provides users with a 360-degree view of their clients and multiple ways of connecting with
                          same.</p>
                        <p class="">The offerings of Salesforce are divided into different products (known as Clouds)
                          based on the features offered by them. Some of the most popular Salesforce offerings include
                          Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, and Field
                          Service Cloud. All these products are designed to help organizations build healthy
                          relationships with their customers.</p>
                        <!-- <p class="">If you are willing to switch to the modern way of handling your customer database, it is important to implement Salesforce the right way.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Essentially, there are two different ways of implementing Salesforce within your organization – the DIY approach and working with a Salesforce implementation partner.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="">As the name suggests, the DIY Salesforce implementation approach involves setting up the CRM platform all by yourself. Although it does not require one to have a degree or educational qualification to implement Salesforce, it is never advisable to do so without taking anyone’s help.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Salesforce is a fairly vast platform with a range of different tools, features, and add-ons. Especially if you are entering the world of Salesforce for the first time, it is never advisable to implement the CRM platform by yourself. Even the best Salesforce implementation guide in the world would not help you build a full-proof CRM platform without seeking professional help!</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Also, Salesforce implementation is certainly a difficult process and a work of experts. Your internal team may not comprise dedicated Salesforce experts. If you force yourself and your in-house professionals to set up Salesforce, the project is bound to fall apart in the near future.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">It is, therefore, advisable to work with a dedicated Salesforce implementation partner.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="bold_heading mt-5">Why Should You Work With A Salesforce Implementation Partner?</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">A Salesforce implementation partner is an individual or a dedicated agency that helps organizations implement the CRM platform effectively. They understand your specific needs and preferences to provide you with tailor-made services. </p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">When you hire a Salesforce implementation partner, you have a subject-matter expert at your disposal. They would guide you every step of the way and prevent you from committing errors while implementing Salesforce. Most implementation partners possess years of experience in the domain and are well-versed with all different aspects of the CRM platform. </p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">A lot of organizations ask the question, “how long does it take to implement Salesforce?”</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Well, while there is no definite answer for the same, the implementation approach you choose certainly makes a difference. If you venture into Salesforce implementation all by yourself, it will take you way longer to get your work done and start with your operations.

                        <!-- <p class="">Now that we have chosen the ideal way of implementing the CRM platform, let us get to the heart of this Salesforce implementation guide.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="">In 2022, you cannot afford to make any mistake when it comes to implementing a cloud-based CRM platform like Salesforce. It is always important to follow the right steps and be systematic in your approach to develop the CRM platform as per your requirements. </p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Here are some of the most important Salesforce implementation steps you should follow to build an ideal CRM for your organization:</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-5"><b>(1) Clearly Define Your Business Goals</b></p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">It is impossible to go anywhere with Salesforce implementation without having well-defined goals. Always start with listing down the important goals that you are willing to achieve through Salesforce implementation.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Here are some important questions to ask yourself while you are defining your business goals:</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  What customers are you willing to cater to?</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Which processes do you want to automate?</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  What are the major issues faced by your organization on a daily basis?</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Do you make use of process automation in the age of digitization?</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Which of your business processes are still traditional and take time?</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Answering questions like these would provide you with a clear sense of direction and help you set a strong foundation for Salesforce implementation.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-5"><b>(2) Identity The Key Stakeholders For The Project</b></p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Once you are thorough with your goals, you can go ahead with identifying all the major stakeholders to be associated with your Salesforce implementation project. These professionals have a vested interest in implementing the CRM platform and helping you achieve your business goals. </p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Some of the most noteworthy stakeholders include:</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; End Users –  </b> These are the individuals who would be using Salesforce once it is implemented. Right from sales and marketing reps to customer service executives, anyone can be an end-user based on the business goals to be achieved.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; Project Manager –  </b> A project manager shoulders the responsibility of bringing your implementation project to fruition. They are responsible for overlooking the entire project, communicating with the clients, coordinating with the team members, and ensuring that the development takes place seamlessly.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; Super Users – </b> These stakeholders may or may not be involved in using the CRM platform once it is built but help the project managers out in testing the platform. They are associated with the implementation process until the final rollout.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull; Decision Makers – </b> As the name suggests, these are the individuals with the authority to make important decisions regarding your Salesforce implementation project. These decisions may revolve around establishing a project timeline, allocating the budget, ensuring effective communication, and much more.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-5"><b>(3) Prepare A Budget</b></p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Another important question asked by organizations related to Salesforce implementation is about the cost of implementation. If you are precise and careful while preparing a budget for your implementation project, the cost of Salesforce implementation would be within your budgetary constraints. However, not preparing an extensive budget or making calculated estimations may make the CRM platform way too costly to implement. </p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">It is, therefore always important to have an extensive budget in place before you go ahead with the implementation. Include all the costs associated with your implementation project and see if the amount is feasible for your organization.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Here, the Salesforce edition you subscribe to plays an important role. On the basis of the features offered, there are four major editions you can subscribe to:</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Salesforce Essentials ($25/user/month)</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="px-4"><b>&bull;</b> &nbsp;  Salesforce Professional ($75/user/month)</p> -->

                        <!-- <p>Once you have decided upon the edition to choose and the number of users you need, you can calculate other costs related to Salesforce implementation.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-5"><b>(4) Building The CRM Platform</b></p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Once you have finalized the cost of implementation, you can start building the CRM platform with the help of your implementation partner. Make sure that you explain your objectives and goals to your Salesforce partner well. This would allow them to add relevant tools and features to the CRM platform. </p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">If needed, you can ask your implementation partner to provide you with different prototypes and versions of your Salesforce org before developing the final version.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-5"><b>(5) Testing The CRM Platform</b></p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Once you have finalized the platform, it is time to test its functionality. You can always request your implementation partner for a visual demo to be well-versed with the functionality of your Salesforce org. If you feel the need to make changes, provide them with feedback and ask them to show you the revised platform.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-5"><b>(6) The Final Launch And User Adoption</b></p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Once all the tests are successful and you are happy with the final product, you can go live with your Salesforce org and start working on the same. However, if the end-users are not too well-versed with the platform, make sure you arrange for extensive user adoption sessions. This would make your team members comfortable with the CRM platform and give them an ideal kick-start!</p> -->

                          two decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record, store, analyze, share, and
                          track your valuable records to provide personalized services to your customers. Right from
                          identifying a prospect to turning them into loyal customers, Salesforce ensures that you are
                          there for your customers at all different stages of their buying journeys.</p>
                        <p class="">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad of different tools
                          and features. This has made the CRM giant divide its features into different products known as

                          department within an organization. For example, while Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to
                          help institutions in the healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing
                          Cloud helps the marketing department of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>

                          Salesforce Sales Cloud facilitates seamless lead management from the moment your sales
                          reps approach your prospects.</p>

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">When a new lead is captured, the CRM platform allows your sales reps to
                          add the same to an automated sales pipeline. It is here that all your leads are
                          nurtured until they are converted. Sales Cloud also helps your sales reps score the
                          leads based on their behaviour and likelihood of getting converted. This way, they can
                          prioritize nurturing the leads that respond positively.</p> -->

                        <p class=""><b>In-depth Analytics:</b></p>

                        <p class="">As mentioned earlier, your customer data forms the core of Salesforce Sales
                          Cloud. Using the same, the CRM platform provides you with valuable insights about your
                          customers and helps your sales reps make informed decisions. Sales Cloud is designed
                          to help you analyze the performance of your sales teams based on their interactions
                          with your prospects and customers.</p>

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">Based on these data-driven analytics, you can reinforce the sales
                          processes that give you favourable results and get rid of the ones that don’t fare
                          well for your organization. Moreover, the analytics helps you identify your best sales
                          reps, the most loyal customers, and the biggest deal closed by your sales team over a
                          specific period of time. </p> -->

                        <p class=""><b>Reports And Dashboards:</b></p>

                        <p class="">In-depth analytics allow Salesforce Sales Cloud to build customizable
                          reports and dashboards for your organization. The CRM platform allows you to use your

                          your sales team. To convey this information in the best way possible, Sales Cloud
                          facilitates seamless data visualization in the form of interactive charts, graphs, and
                          animations.</p>

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">Moreover, the CRM solution provides you with extensive dashboards that
                          provide you with the real-time status of all sales processes being carried out by your
                          sales reps across the board. This data can be used to track the performance of
                          specific sales reps and the journey of leads nurtured by them.</p> -->

                        <p class=""><b>Sales Forecasting:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Einstein, the AI component of Salesforce, can be incorporated within the
                          Sales Cloud to enhance the performance of your sales department. The use of AI helps
                          you forecast sales based on real-time as well as historical data stored within your
                          CRM platform. Salesforce Einstein can also be used to predict the behaviour of your
                          customers to create a targeted sales campaign.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Along with making sales forecasts, AI can be used to provide your sales

                          individual customer catered to by an organization. On the other hand, an account
                          refers to a business organization acting as a customer consisting of different
                          contacts.</p>

                          enterprises handling complex business processes. However, that is certainly not true.
                          Salesforce

                          fundamental features of contact, account, opportunity, and lead management.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">It also facilitates a seamless email integration with Gmail or Outlook.

                        <p class=""><b>Mobile Customization:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Today, the need for using business applications on mobile devices is
                          immense. From the basic edition itself, Salesforce Sales Cloud provides users with
                          access to a responsive mobile application. The application allows your sales reps to

                          facilitated by the desktop version.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Tapping The Right Opportunities:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Along with managing leads, contacts, and accounts, Salesforce Sales Cloud
                          also allows users to manage sales opportunities. The centralized platform shows your
                          sales reps all the opportunities available to them and helps them in tapping them in

                          opportunities to increase the chances of winning them.</p>

                          customers for your business. </p>

                        <p class=""><b>Improved Productivity:</b></p>

                        <p class="">The CRM platform provides your sales team with a plethora of advanced and

                        <p class=""><b>Shortening Your Sales Cycle:</b></p>

                        <p class="">A prolonged sales cycle leads to dissatisfied customers and makes you lose

                        <p class="mt-4 box_heading">Key Features Of Salesforce Service Cloud:</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Seamless Case Management:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Case management is the primary feature offered by Salesforce Service Cloud.
                          Whenever a customer faces any issue and decided to seek help from your organization,
                          it leads to the creation of a new case.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">There are three distinct ways in which the Service Cloud allows users to
                          create and manage cases – web-to-case, email-to-case, and escalation. </p>

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">Web-to-case revolves around the automated creation of a new case when a
                          user receives a support request from the company’s website. This is when your
                          customers seek support through your official website. You can either choose to handle
                          such cases by routing them to the right agents or provide your customers with a
                          personalized auto-response.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">Email-to-case allows Salesforce Service Cloud users to create a new case
                          when an email looking for support has been sent to the designated email ID of your
                          business. The software displays all these cases in a list called “Emails Related
                          List.” This list contains multiple emails related to a single case and different email
                          threads.</p> -->

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">If a case is not closed within the pre-determined period of time,
                          Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to use the case escalation rules to reassign the
                          concerned case and inform the customer about the same. </p> -->

                        <p class=""><b>Einstein Bots:</b></p>

                        <!-- <p class="">Conversational AI has brought a revolution in the domain of customer
                          services. The technology involves the creation of AI chatbots that interact with
                          customers, understand the context of their questions/issues, and provide them with
                          personalized solutions without routing the cases to support agents right away.</p> -->

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud employs these virtual assistants in the form of
                          Einstein bots. These chatbots can be used to overcome the unnecessary delays caused in
                          resolving basic issues faced by your customers. If a customer raises a simple query,

                          satisfied with the response, they can ask the chatbots to route their case to a

                        <p class=""><b>Seamless Communication:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Communication plays the most important part when it comes to providing
                          personalized support to your customers. Salesforce Service Cloud facilitates seamless
                          communication across multiple, channels, including web, email, mobile, and social
                          media. Irrespective of the medium through which your customers engage with you, you
                          can provide them with the right support at the right time.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Better Agent Productivity:</b></p>

                        <p class="">When your agents have all the information they need at their fingertips,
                          they tend to feel more confident about their work and more engaged. Moreover,
                          Salesforce Service Cloud facilitates process automation and workflow management in a
                          way that reduces errors committed by your agents. This makes the service agents more
                          productive, allowing them to resolve all their cases in the best way possible.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Personalized Support:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Salesforce Service Cloud helps organizations steer away from providing
                          conventional and generic support. Thanks to the CRM platform of Salesforce and
                          Salesforce Knowledge, your service agents can extract all necessary information about
                          the case at hand and tailor their support accordingly. Personalized support always
                          makes customers feel special and allows you to build a healthy relationship with them.

                        <p class="">With the Service Cloud, agents can track all the cases handled by them to
                          ensure that they are resolved on time. The cloud-based platform is designed to help
                          users route the right cases to the right agent, removing all possible hurdles along
                          the way.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>The Use Of AI:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Salesforce Einstein (the AI component of Salesforce) allows the platform to
                          make smart decisions and assessments in the best interest of the users. Right from
                          employing AI chatbots to provide the first level of support to providing service
                          agents with personalized recommendations, the Service Cloud optimizes AI and machine
                          learning to leverage your support processes. Moreover, these technologies allow the
                          platform to grow as your service agents resolve more cases. </p>

                          customers across their journeys and making specific decisions.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Mobile Studior:</b></p>

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">As the name suggests, Mobile Studio is a tool that allows marketers to
                          create seamless and targeted campaigns using SMS, group messages, and push
                          notifications. It helps you reach out to your prospects and customers through their
                          mobile phones and persuade them to engage with your business. Right from creating
                          personalized text messages to marketing your business on WhatsApp, Mobile Studio helps
                          you send the right messages to the right customers.</p> -->

                        <p class="mt-3">With Mobile Studio, you can gather and analyze the preferences of your
                          customers through group messages. These responses can be used for consistent messaging
                          across different channels (with the consent of your customers). Just like Email
                          Studio, Mobile Studio allows you to schedule your promotional messages to ensure that
                          the messages reach the recipients at the right time.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Social Studio:</b></p>

                        <!-- <p class="">Social Studio is designed to help marketers create holistic social media
                          campaigns across different platforms. It connects your sales, service, and marketing
                          teams to engage with your customers on social media and create fruitful relationships
                          with them on the same.</p> -->

                        <p class="mt-3">With Social Studio, you get a 360-degree view of your customers’ actions
                          and engagement on specific social media platforms. Based on these actions, you can
                          assess their preferences and approach the right people at the right time. The social
                          studio also allows you to create, publish, and share promotional content across social
                          media platforms.</p>

                        <!-- <p class="mt-3">Moreover, you can use Social Studio for integrating mentions and

                        <!-- <p class="mt-5 box_heading">Why Should You Implement Salesforce Marketing Cloud In 2022?</p>

                        <p class=""> <b>Personalized Marketing Campaigns:</b> </p>

                        <p class="">Gone are the days when businesses used to create generic marketing campaigns
                          and customers used to respond favourably to the same. In 2022, customers demand to be
                          treated specially and want their specific preferences to be prioritized while engaging
                          with a brand. Salesforce Marketing Cloud allows you to create marketing campaigns that
                          are unique for all your customers and cater to their specific requirements.</p>

                        <p class=""> <b>Advanced Analytic:s</b> </p>

                        <p class="">Salesforce Marketing Cloud keeps track of all records pertaining to the
                          interactions with your prospects and customers. This data allows your marketing team
                          to make important decisions and tweak your campaigns to get the desired results. By
                          implementing the Marketing Cloud, you can have all relevant details about your
                          marketing processes at your disposal, allowing you to make the right decisions.</p>

                        <p class=""> <b>Tracking Your Customers’ Buying Journeys:</b> </p>

                        <p class="">You may lose your customers if they are not assisted the right way at
                          specific stages of their buying journeys. Salesforce Marketing Cloud prevents this
                          from happening by allowing you to track the journeys of your customers. Right from
                          identifying important touchpoints to tracking their actions, the platform lets you be
                          there for your customers at every stage.</p>

                        <p class=""> <b>Creating Targeted Calls-to-action (CTAs):</b> </p>

                        <p class="">CTAs always play a pivotal role in any marketing campaign as they prompt the
                          customers to engage with the concerned business. Despite a powerful marketing
                          campaign, you can lose customers if you do not provide them with the right CTAs.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Marketing Cloud helps you provide personalized calls to
                          action to your customers according to their profiles, purchase history, preferences,
                          and interests. This increases the chances of them taking the required action and
                          engaging with your brand.</p>

                        <p class=""> <b>The Use Of AI:</b> </p>

                        <p class="">Marketing Cloud incorporates Einstein (the AI component of Salesforce) to
                          leverage your marketing processes. This allows you to make intelligent predictions
                          about the behaviours of your customers and forecast the results of your marketing
                          campaigns. This way, you can minimize the risks involved in marketing your offerings
                          and getting the desired results.</p>

                        <p class=""> <b>Cross-channel Marketing:</b> </p>

                        <p class="">Salesforce Marketing Cloud is equipped to help market your business across
                          multiple channels, including web, email, mobile, and social media. Instead of
                          switching between different solutions, it helps you handle all your marketing
                          campaigns from a single unified platform. </p>

                        <p class="bold_text">The Final Word</p>
                        <p>These were some of the most important aspects worth considering before you implement
                          Salesforce Marketing Cloud in 2022. We live in the age of digitization and it calls for
                          making the much-needed switch to cloud-based platforms like the Marketing Cloud. If you want
                          to thrive in the market you operate in and get an edge over your peers, you should start
