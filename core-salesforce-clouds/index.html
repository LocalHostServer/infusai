                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce has been helping organizations manage their customer databases for over two
                  decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record, store, analyze, share, and track your
                  valuable records to provide personalized services to your customers. Right from identifying a prospect
                  to turning them into loyal customers, Salesforce ensures that you are there for your customers at all
                  different stages of their buying journeys. </p>

                <p class="mt-3">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad of different tools and
                  features. This has made the CRM giant divide its features into different products known as Salesforce
                  Clouds. </p>

                <p class="mt-3">Every Salesforce Cloud is an offering that provides users with a specific set of tools
                  and features. These features can be related to a specific sector of industry or a department within an
                  organization. For example, while Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to help institutions in the
                  healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing Cloud helps the marketing department
                  of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">Leverage our years of industry experience and expertise to build, and implement the
                  smartest way
                  Salesforce Cloud services divided into these offerings allow users to choose the products that are
                  best suited for them. Irrespective of the scale at which you operate and the industry you belong to,
                  you will always find a Salesforce Cloud that is in sync with your needs and preferences.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">While there are many different Salesforce products you can choose from, there are three
                  core Salesforce Clouds that are highly preferred by users around the world – Sales Cloud, Service
                  Cloud, and Marketing Cloud.</p>

                      <p class="">We live in the age of digitization. Gone are the days when organizations used to keep
                        manual records of their customers to cater to their needs. Today, the advent of automated and
                        cloud-based platforms has made customer relationship management (CRM) a lot more efficient. With

                        implementing the CRM giant and the steps involved in the same. </p>
                      <p class="">However, before getting to the crux of this Salesforce implementation guide, let us
                        brush our knowledge of what Salesforce is and why it is relevant in 2022.</p>

                      <p class="bold_heading mt-5">What Is Salesforce And Why Is It Relevant In 2022?</p>
                      <p class="">Salesforce is arguably the most popular CRM platform in the market that helps
                        organizations manage their customer records on a centralized platform. It prevents you from
                        resorting to tedious and time-consuming methods by providing you with automated tools and
                        applications.</p>
                      <p class="">It has been more than two decades since Salesforce was launched. However, the CRM
                        platform is still highly relevant across multiple industries. This is because it has evolved
                        with time and is in sync with the latest technological trends in the market. With Salesforce,
                        you can record, store, track, assess, and share your valuable records to provide personalized
                        services to your customers. Right from sales reps to finance experts, the CRM platform provides
                        users with a 360-degree view of their clients and multiple ways of connecting with same.</p>
                      <p class="">The offerings of Salesforce are divided into different products (known as Clouds)
                        based on the features offered by them. Some of the most popular Salesforce offerings include
                        Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, and Field Service
                        Cloud. All these products are designed to help organizations build healthy relationships with
                        their customers.</p>

                      <p class="">Salesforce has been helping organizations manage their customer databases for over two
                        decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record, store, analyze, share, and track

                        customers at all different stages of their buying journeys.</p>
                      <p class="">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad of different tools and

                        institutions in the healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing Cloud
                        helps the marketing department of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>
                      <p class="">Salesforce Cloud services divided into these offerings allow users to choose the

                                  refers to a business organization acting as a customer consisting of different

                        king. Almost each of your business processes revolves around catering to the needs and
                        preferences of your customers. They hold a pivotal position in dictating the strategies and
                        approaches of the businesses they engage with.
                        This is why it is important to provide them with adequate support services.</p>

                        issues are resolved in the best way possible.</p>

                                <p class="">Conversational AI has brought a revolution in the domain of customer
                                  services. The technology involves the creation of AI chatbots that interact with
                                  customers, understand the context of their questions/issues, and provide them with
                                  personalized solutions without routing the cases to support agents right away.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud employs these virtual assistants in the form of
                                  Einstein bots. These chatbots can be used to overcome the unnecessary delays caused in
                                  resolving basic issues faced by your customers. If a customer raises a simple query,
                                  they can get it resolved by interacting with the chatbots. In case they are not
                                  satisfied with the response, they can ask the chatbots to route their case to a
                                  suitable support agent. This allows you to bring in manual assistance only when
                                  required.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to optimize Salesforce Knowledge, an
                                  extensive knowledge base where you can create, edit, and manage content. If you are
                                  using chatbots to provide the initial level of support, they would scan the knowledge

                                  customer involved. This provides your agent with enough information to understand the

                      <p class="">We live in the age of digitization. Gone are the days when organizations used to keep
                        manual records of their customers to cater to their needs. Today, the advent of automated and
                        cloud-based platforms has made customer relationship management (CRM) a lot more efficient. With

                        implementing the CRM giant and the steps involved in the same. </p>
                      <p class="">However, before getting to the crux of this Salesforce implementation guide, let us
                        brush our knowledge of what Salesforce is and why it is relevant in 2022.</p>
                      <p class="bold_heading mt-5">What Is Salesforce And Why Is It Relevant In 2022?</p>
                      <p class="">Salesforce is arguably the most popular CRM platform in the market that helps
                        organizations manage their customer records on a centralized platform. It prevents you from
                        resorting to tedious and time-consuming methods by providing you with automated tools and
                        applications.</p>
                      <p class="">It has been more than two decades since Salesforce was launched. However, the CRM
                        platform is still highly relevant across multiple industries. This is because it has evolved
                        with time and is in sync with the latest technological trends in the market. With Salesforce,
                        you can record, store, track, assess, and share your valuable records to provide personalized
                        services to your customers. Right from sales reps to finance experts, the CRM platform provides
                        users with a 360-degree view of their clients and multiple ways of connecting with same.</p>
                      <p class="">The offerings of Salesforce are divided into different products (known as Clouds)
                        based on the features offered by them. Some of the most popular Salesforce offerings include
                        Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, and Field Service
                        Cloud. All these products are designed to help organizations build healthy relationships with
                        their customers.</p>

                      <p class="">Salesforce has been helping organizations manage their customer databases for over two
                        decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record, store, analyze, share, and track
                        your valuable records to provide personalized services to your customers. Right from identifying
                        a prospect to turning them into loyal customers, Salesforce ensures that you are there for your
                        customers at all different stages of their buying journeys.</p>
                      <p class="">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad of different tools and
                        features. This has made the CRM giant divide its features into different products known as
                        Salesforce Clouds.</p>

                        within an organization. For example, while Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to help
                        institutions in the healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing Cloud
                        helps the marketing department of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>
                      <p class="">Salesforce Cloud services divided into these offerings allow users to choose the
                        products that are best suited for them. Irrespective of the scale at which you operate and the
                        industry you belong to, you will always find a Salesforce Cloud that is in sync with your needs

                                <p class="">Case management is the primary feature offered by Salesforce Service Cloud.
                                  Whenever a customer faces any issue and decided to seek help from your organization,
                                  it leads to the creation of a new case.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">There are three distinct ways in which the Service Cloud allows users to
                                  create and manage cases – web-to-case, email-to-case, and escalation. </p>

                                <!-- <p class="mt-3">Web-to-case revolves around the automated creation of a new case when a
                                  user receives a support request from the company’s website. This is when your
                                  customers seek support through your official website. You can either choose to handle
                                  such cases by routing them to the right agents or provide your customers with a
                                  personalized auto-response.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Email-to-case allows Salesforce Service Cloud users to create a new case
                                  when an email looking for support has been sent to the designated email ID of your
                                  business. The software displays all these cases in a list called “Emails Related
                                  List.” This list contains multiple emails related to a single case and different email
                                  threads.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">If a case is not closed within the pre-determined period of time,
                                  Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to use the case escalation rules to reassign the
                                  concerned case and inform the customer about the same. </p> -->

                                <p class="">Conversational AI has brought a revolution in the domain of customer
                                  services. The technology involves the creation of AI chatbots that interact with
                                  customers, understand the context of their questions/issues, and provide them with
                                  personalized solutions without routing the cases to support agents right away.</p>

                                <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud employs these virtual assistants in the form of
                                  Einstein bots. These chatbots can be used to overcome the unnecessary delays caused in
                                  resolving basic issues faced by your customers. If a customer raises a simple query,
                                  they can get it resolved by interacting with the chatbots. In case they are not
                                  satisfied with the response, they can ask the chatbots to route their case to a
                                  suitable support agent. This allows you to bring in manual assistance only when
                                  required.</p>

                        <p class="bold_heading">A Comprehensive Salesforce Implementation Guide For 2022</p>
                        <p class="">We live in the age of digitization. Gone are the days when organizations used to
                          keep manual records of their customers to cater to their needs. Today, the advent of automated
                          and cloud-based platforms has made customer relationship management (CRM) a lot more
                          efficient. With this Salesforce implementation guide, we would understand the different
                          approaches to implementing the CRM giant and the steps involved in the same. </p>
                        <p class="">However, before getting to the crux of this Salesforce implementation guide, let us
                          brush our knowledge of what Salesforce is and why it is relevant in 2022.</p>

                        <p class="bold_heading mt-5">What Is Salesforce And Why Is It Relevant In 2022?</p>
                        <p class="">Salesforce is arguably the most popular CRM platform in the market that helps
                          organizations manage their customer records on a centralized platform. It prevents you from
                          resorting to tedious and time-consuming methods by providing you with automated tools and
                          applications.</p>
                        <p class="">It has been more than two decades since Salesforce was launched. However, the CRM
                          platform is still highly relevant across multiple industries. This is because it has evolved
                          with time and is in sync with the latest technological trends in the market. With Salesforce,
                          you can record, store, track, assess, and share your valuable records to provide personalized
                          services to your customers. Right from sales reps to finance experts, the CRM platform
                          provides users with a 360-degree view of their clients and multiple ways of connecting with
                          same.</p>
                        <p class="">The offerings of Salesforce are divided into different products (known as Clouds)
                          based on the features offered by them. Some of the most popular Salesforce offerings include
                          Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, and Field
                          Service Cloud. All these products are designed to help organizations build healthy
                          relationships with their customers.</p>
                        <!-- <p class="">If you are willing to switch to the modern way of handling your customer database, it is important to implement Salesforce the right way.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p class="">Essentially, there are two different ways of implementing Salesforce within your organization – the DIY approach and working with a Salesforce implementation partner.</p> -->

                        <p class="">Salesforce has been helping organizations manage their customer databases for over
                          two decades. With the cloud-based CRM platform, you can record, store, analyze, share, and
                          track your valuable records to provide personalized services to your customers. Right from
                          identifying a prospect to turning them into loyal customers, Salesforce ensures that you are
                          there for your customers at all different stages of their buying journeys.</p>
                        <p class="">The functionality of Salesforce is fairly diverse with a myriad of different tools
                          and features. This has made the CRM giant divide its features into different products known as
                          Salesforce Clouds.</p>
                        <p class="">Every Salesforce Cloud is an offering that provides users with a specific set of
                          tools and features. These features can be related to a specific sector of industry or a
                          department within an organization. For example, while Salesforce Health Cloud is designed to
                          help institutions in the healthcare sector streamline their services, Salesforce Marketing
                          Cloud helps the marketing department of an organization reach out to the clients better.</p>
                        <p class="">Salesforce Cloud services divided into these offerings allow users to choose the
                          products that are best suited for them. Irrespective of the scale at which you operate and the
                          industry you belong to, you will always find a Salesforce Cloud that is in sync with your
                          needs and preferences.</p>

                          cloud-based CRM platform. For more than two decades, Salesforce has been helping organizations
                          make the most of their customer database and provide personalized services to their customers.
                          The CRM platform facilitates the recording, storing, tracking, and assessment of valuable
                          business records on a centralized and automated platform.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4 bold_heading">What Is Salesforce Sales Cloud?</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Sales Cloud is a cloud-based SaaS solution that allows organizations

                          reps.
                        </p>


                        <p class="mt-4 box_heading">Key Features Of Sales Cloud:</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Lead Management:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Sales processes are always incomplete without adequate lead management. If
                          are able to manage your leads well, you can convert them into loyal customers.
                          Salesforce Sales Cloud facilitates seamless lead management from the moment your sales
                          reps approach your prospects.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Sales Cloud organizes the entire process of lead management
                          to help you close maximum sales deals and drive the desired revenue home.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>In-depth Analytics:</b></p>

                        <p class="">As mentioned earlier, your customer data forms the core of Salesforce Sales
                          Cloud. Using the same, the CRM platform provides you with valuable insights about your
                          customers and helps your sales reps make informed decisions. Sales Cloud is designed
                          to help you analyze the performance of your sales teams based on their interactions
                          with your prospects and customers.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Reports And Dashboards:</b></p>

                        <p class="">In-depth analytics allow Salesforce Sales Cloud to build customizable
                          reports and dashboards for your organization. The CRM platform allows you to use your
                          CRM data to create reports that convey valuable information about the performance of
                          your sales team. To convey this information in the best way possible, Sales Cloud
                          facilitates seamless data visualization in the form of interactive charts, graphs, and
                          animations.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Sales Forecasting:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Einstein, the AI component of Salesforce, can be incorporated within the
                          Sales Cloud to enhance the performance of your sales department. The use of AI helps
                          you forecast sales based on real-time as well as historical data stored within your
                          CRM platform. Salesforce Einstein can also be used to predict the behaviour of your
                          customers to create a targeted sales campaign.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Along with making sales forecasts, AI can be used to provide your sales
                          reps with personalized suggestions and recommendations to improve their performance.
                        </p>

                        <p class=""><b>Contact And Account Management:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Salesforce Sales Cloud allows businesses to store information about their
                          customers in two major categories – contacts and accounts. A contact refers to an
                          individual customer catered to by an organization. On the other hand, an account
                          refers to a business organization acting as a customer consisting of different
                          contacts.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Sales Cloud allows your sales reps to manage contacts and accounts from
                          a centralized platform. All the records stored within these categories can be used to
                          provide personalized services to your customers.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Irrespective of the products or services you deal in, the customer is always the
                          king. Almost each of your business processes revolves around catering to the needs and
                          preferences of your customers. They hold a pivotal position in dictating the strategies and
                          approaches of the businesses they engage with.
                          This is why it is important to provide them with adequate support services.</p>

                        <p class="mt-4 bold_heading">What Is Salesforce Service Cloud?</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud is a highly sought-after Salesforce product that allows
                          you to provide quick and personalized support to your customers. The CRM platform allows you
                          to
                          handle your cases in a streamlined and automated manner to tailor your services based on the
                          specific needs of your customers. </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud is a solution that acts as a customer service platform
                          and a helpdesk to provide wholesome support to your customers. It provides users with a range
                          of
                          different features and tools such as service consoles, process automation, dashboards,
                          analytics, and much more. </p>

                        <p class="mt-4 box_heading">Key Features Of Salesforce Service Cloud:</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Seamless Case Management:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Case management is the primary feature offered by Salesforce Service Cloud.
                          Whenever a customer faces any issue and decided to seek help from your organization,
                          it leads to the creation of a new case.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">There are three distinct ways in which the Service Cloud allows users to
                          create and manage cases – web-to-case, email-to-case, and escalation. </p>

                        <p class=""><b>Einstein Bots:</b></p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud employs these virtual assistants in the form of
                          Einstein bots. These chatbots can be used to overcome the unnecessary delays caused in
                          resolving basic issues faced by your customers. If a customer raises a simple query,
                          they can get it resolved by interacting with the chatbots. In case they are not
                          satisfied with the response, they can ask the chatbots to route their case to a
                          suitable support agent. This allows you to bring in manual assistance only when
                          required.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Salesforce Knowledge:</b></p>

                        <p class="">The enterprise knowledge base is one of the most important assets possessed
                          by your organization. It contains all important information regarding your company,
                          its offerings, and the customers. </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Salesforce Service Cloud allows you to optimize Salesforce Knowledge, an
                          extensive knowledge base where you can create, edit, and manage content. If you are
                          using chatbots to provide the initial level of support, they would scan the knowledge
                          base to provide personalized solutions to your customers.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Agent Console:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Agent Console is a tool designed specifically for support agents to make
                          their work easier. It provides them with a 360-degree view of all the previous and
                          ongoing cases managed by them. Right from customer profiles and history of
                          interactions to extensive dashboards, the Agent Console provides your service agents
                          with a centralized platform with a plethora of resources.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Service Cloud Voice:</b></p>

                        <p class="">This is an AI-based feature that converts telephony conversations into
                          transcripts live. The feature can be used for analyzing the agents’ interactions with
                          customers, providing them with adequate feedback, and training agents to improve their
                          services.</p>

                        <p class=""><b>Service Cloud Analytics:</b></p>

                        <p class="">Salesforce Service Cloud helps users analyze their performance as they
                          engage with customers and resolve their cases. The automated provides users with
                          valuable insights about their performances and a snapshot of every case handled by
                          them. This data can be used for reinforcing the techniques that work in providing
                          seamless customer support getting rid of the ones that don’t work well.</p>
